    "    Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.\n"
